Chat-Application: Real-time Communication Platform
Welcome to our Chat-Application project! This is a real-time chat application developed as a school project, designed to facilitate seamless communication through direct messages, group chats, and media sharing. Our goal was to build a functional and responsive platform that demonstrates key concepts in modern web and mobile development.

‚ú® Key Features
Real-time Messaging: Experience instant message delivery and updates powered by WebSockets.

Direct & Group Chats: Connect with friends in one-on-one conversations or collaborate in dynamic group environments.

Media Sharing: Easily send and receive images, videos, and audio messages within your chats.

User & Group Profiles: Manage your profile and group details, including custom profile pictures.

User Authentication: Secure login and registration system to protect user accounts.

Online Status: See at a glance which of your contacts are currently online.

Dynamic Sidebar: The chat list on your homepage updates in real-time to show the latest conversations.

üöÄ Technologies Used
This project is built using a robust and popular stack, combining the power of Node.js for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and Capacitor for mobile deployment.

Backend
Node.js: Our server-side runtime, enabling fast and scalable network applications.

Express.js: A lightweight and flexible Node.js web application framework, used for building our RESTful APIs.

Socket.IO: The backbone of our real-time communication, providing bidirectional, event-based communication between clients and the server.

MongoDB: A flexible NoSQL database, chosen for its ability to store our application's data, including users, messages, and groups.

Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, simplifying data interaction and validation.

Cloudinary: A cloud-based service for efficient storage and delivery of all media files (images, videos, audio) shared within the chats.

Frontend
React.js: Our chosen JavaScript library for building the interactive and dynamic user interface.

Zustand: A minimalist, fast, and scalable state-management solution for React, keeping our application's data organized and accessible.

Axios: A powerful, promise-based HTTP client for making requests to our backend APIs.

Lucide React: Provides a set of beautiful and consistent open-source icons, enhancing the visual appeal of our application.

React Router DOM: Used for navigating between different pages and views within our single-page application.

Mobile Development
Capacitor: An essential tool that allows us to package our web application into native iOS and Android apps, providing a truly cross-platform experience.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started (Local Setup)
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Version 18 or higher (download from nodejs.org).

npm or Yarn: (npm v9+ or Yarn v1.22+ recommended) - usually comes with Node.js.

MongoDB Instance: You'll need a running MongoDB database. You can use a local installation or a cloud-hosted service like MongoDB Atlas.

Cloudinary Account: Sign up for a free account at cloudinary.com to handle media uploads.

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chat-Application.git
cd Chat-Application

(Remember to replace your-username with the actual GitHub path if you fork or move it.)

2. Backend Setup
Navigate into the Backend directory, install necessary dependencies, and configure your environment variables.

cd Backend
npm install # or yarn install

Next, create a file named .env directly inside the Backend directory. Populate it with your specific credentials and configurations:

MONGO_DB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
JWT_SECRET=a_very_strong_and_unique_secret_key_for_jwt_tokens
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name_here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret_here
PORT=5001 # The port your backend server will run on (e.g., http://localhost:5001)

Important: Replace the placeholder values (your_..._here) with your actual keys and connection strings. Do not share your .env file publicly.

3. Frontend Setup
Navigate back to the root of the project (Chat-Application), then enter the Frontend directory to install its dependencies.

cd ../Frontend
npm install # or yarn install

The frontend application is configured to communicate with the backend running on http://localhost:5001 during development.

4. Running the Application
Once both backend and frontend dependencies are installed and .env is configured, you can start the application.

Start the Backend Server
Open a new terminal window, navigate to the Backend directory, and run:

npm start # or node server.js (if your start script is not defined)

The backend server should start and be accessible at http://localhost:5001.

Start the Frontend Development Server
Open another terminal window, navigate to the Frontend directory, and run:

npm run dev

The frontend development server will typically start on http://localhost:5173 (Vite's default) or http://localhost:3000.

Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173) to see the application in action.

üì± Mobile Development (Capacitor)
If you wish to build and test the application on iOS or Android devices:

Install Capacitor CLI Globally:

npm install -g @capacitor/cli

Initialize Capacitor in your Frontend:
From the Frontend directory:

npx cap init "WhisprChat" "com.yourcompany.whisprchat" --web-dir dist

Note: We're using dist as the --web-dir here, which is common for Vite projects. Verify your frontend's build output directory (e.g., check vite.config.js or your package.json's build script).

Build Your React App for Production:
This compiles your React code into static web assets. From the Frontend directory:

npm run build # or yarn build

Copy Web Assets to Capacitor:
This moves your built web assets into the Capacitor project. From the Frontend directory:

npx cap copy

Add Native Platforms:
From the Frontend directory:

npx cap add ios
npx cap add android

Open in Native IDEs:
To work with the native projects (e.g., run on an emulator or device), open them in their respective IDEs:

npx cap open ios    # Opens Xcode for iOS development
npx cap open android # Opens Android Studio for Android development

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment (Render.com)
This application is designed for easy continuous deployment using platforms like Render.com.

Connect your GitHub Repository: Link your Chat-Application GitHub repository to your Render account.

Configure The App Service: Create a new "Web Service" on Render.

After creating a new web service go to Start command and type in npm run build

go to start command then type npm run start then add your instance type below

Add your .env files from the backend to the Enviroment variables make sure not to include NODE_ENV

Continuous Deployment: Once configured, Render will automatically detect new pushes to your connected Git branch, rebuild, and deploy your application seamlessly.
